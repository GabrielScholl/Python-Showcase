# This file goes on to show the different types of comments in Python

# This is a comment

print('Hi') # This is also a comment, but at the end of a line

'''This is a different type of comment, 
that can be multiple lines long.'''

"""
Double qotes can also be used for this purpose.
And neither have to be at the same line as the comments,
Just before and after.

def more(code):
    # print("I do nothing because I'm commented")
    return

# And that about covers comments in Python
